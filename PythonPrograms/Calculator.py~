#Name: Simple calculator
#Description: A terminal calculator, with standard operators


#Menu function: Displays the operator menu
def menu():

1) '+' for addition
2) '-' for subtraction
3) 'x' for multiplication
4) '/' for division
5) 'pwr' to put the previous number to a certain power
6) 'root' to put the previous number to a certain root

Type either the symbol or the number that corresponds with your choice, e.g. 'x' or '3' for multiplication.
Or, if you want to exit the program, type in 'QUIT'\n""")
